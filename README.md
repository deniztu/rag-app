# RAG Application using langchain and azure openai

This project is based on a data science project I worked on as a freelancer. It demonstrates the implementation of a Streamlit application that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to solve search for products.

Based on the question the system routes between a vector database or a sql database. For transparency the relevant pdf document is shown to the user.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval mechanisms with generative AI for enhanced performance.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **LangChain and LangGraph**: Utilizes LangChain and LanGraph for building and managing the application's logic and workflows.
- **Re-ranking and Routing**: Implements re-ranking to optimize retrieval results and routing mechanisms to switch between a vector database (semantic search) and an SQL database for optimal results.
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Leverages LLMs to extract structured data from PDF files efficiently.
